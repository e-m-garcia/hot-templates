# High-Redshift Optmized Templates (HOT)
*Sets of templates for EAZY and Le Phare photometric template fitting at z > 8*

HOT consists of template sets that are optimized for better inference of galactic properties for very high redshift, photometric objects. This is accomplished by asserting hotter gas temperatures of 45K and 60K in star-forming regions for z = 8-12 and z > 12 respectively, resulting in bottom-lighter/top-heavier IMFs. For further details and justification, refer to `the corresponding paper here <insert link>`__.
